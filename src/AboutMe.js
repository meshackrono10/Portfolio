                I am a driven front end developer with a passion for thoughtful
                UI design, collaboration and lifelong learning. Given my
                extensive experience in hospitality, I am able to effectively
                communicate with people of all backgrounds and successfully
                adapt to any situation. A fulfilling career would combine my
                tech skills and my passion for working with others and helping
                them efficiently achieve their goals. I look forward to joining
                a team that is committed to using technology to make a positive
                impact on the world. My current stack includes HTML, CSS, React
                and I have experience working with GOOGLE FIREBASE for backend .
                When Iâ€™m not coding or participating in a in sports, I enjoy
                learning new technologies, exploring cuisines of different
                cultures, and serving up a mean gravlax. <br />
                Work hard, be nice, get positive, stay hungry and have faith
